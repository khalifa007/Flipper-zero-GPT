BasicsFirmware update﻿We are constantly updating the Flipper Zero firmware, which is why it is important to update your Flipper Zero regularly. You can update your Flipper Zero via theFlipper Mobile ApporqFlipper.There are three firmware update channels:﻿DEVELOPMENT (Dev):the ongoing development is constantly building a new version of the firmware with every new commit, often multiple times per day. This Development version includes all the latest features, but it may be unstable, cause freezing or corruption of your data, or fail to function altogether.﻿RELEASE-CANDIDATE (RC):the version submitted for validation testing to the QA department. If any bugs are detected during the testing phase, the version is revised, and a new Release candidate is issued. Once the release candidate successfully passes all tests, it becomes the Release version.﻿RELEASE:the stable version of the firmware is extensively tested to ensure its reliability and is therefore recommended for general use.<divclass="warning flipper-callout"><divclass="callout-header">Insert a microSD card before the update procedure</div>A microSD card must be inserted into your Flipper Zero to update the firmware correctly.

125 kHz RFIDAnimal microchips﻿Amicrochipis a radio-frequency identification (RFID)transponderthat stores a unique identification number and is roughly the size of a grain of rice. The microchip is implanted under the animal's skin. When scanned with a reader, the microchip transmits its ID number. This ID number can help you find information about the animal and its owner if added to a database.Flipper Zero allows you to read animal microchips thanks to its low-frequency RFID antenna. The Flipper Zero antenna was designed to operate at 125 kHz, while most animal microchips operate at 134.2 kHz. Support for reading 134.2 kHz microchips was implemented as an additional feature. To read microchip data, hold your Flipper Zero for three seconds over the microchip of the animal you want to identify. Otherwise, Flipper Zero won't detect the microchip.On this page, you will learn how to locate and read animal microchips as well as find information about the animal in online pet recovery services.﻿Animal RFID microchips supported by Flipper ZeroCompatible microchips:FDX-B(15-digit, ISO-compliant, including thermo microchips), FDX-A (10-digit, not ISO-compliant), and other chips supported by Flipper Zero in the form factor of an animal microchip.Reading frequency:125 kHz. Flipper Zero can also read microchips in the 110-140 kHz range but with a shorter reading distance.Reading distance:10 mm (0.39 inch).﻿Reading animal microchipsAnimal microchips can be located atdifferent sites. In dogs and cats, one microchip is usually inserted below the skin at the back of the neckbetween the shoulder bladeson the dorsal midline. Continental European pets get a microchipin the midway region of the left neck.Implantation sites﻿Method 1. Locating the microchip with your fingersWe recommend to first locate the animal microchip with your fingers and then read it with your Flipper Zero. Move your fingertips over the pet’s skin between the shoulder blades and the midway region of the left neck. Apply gentle pressure to see if you can detect a solid rice-grain-sized object just under the skin. Mind that animal microchips might migrate slightly from the original location.Once you’ve located the microchip, scan it with your Flipper Zero using the ASK coding:1Go toMain Menu -> 125 kHz RFID -> Extra Actions.2SelectRead ASKand press %ok%OK.3Hold your Flipper Zero as close as possible to the microchip, and don't move the device for three seconds.Hold your Flipper Zero so that the microchip is in the center of the device's back.﻿4Review the captured data.Method 2. Locating the microchip with your Flipper ZeroTo locate and read the animal microchip, you need to position your Flipper Zero precisely atop the microchip as close as possible and wait for three seconds. To increase the chance of detecting the animal microchip, we recommend reading in the ASK coding mode:1Go toMain Menu -> 125 kHz RFID -> Extra Action.2SelectRead ASKand press %ok%OK.3Move your Flipper Zero as close as possible to the pet's skin (the device's back facing the animal's skin) and move the device step by step, holding it for three seconds at each location.It is important to keep your Flipper Zero still for three seconds at every stop.﻿Move your Flipper Zero in the pattern shown below until the microchip is detected.Front-to-back scanning pattern in the area between the shoulder blades and the left side of the neck﻿Pay attention to the LED indication on your Flipper Zero:LED indication will help you to locate the microchip﻿If the microchip wasn't detected, rotate your Flipper Zero 90° and repeat the scanning procedure as shown below.Side-to-side scanning pattern in the area between the shoulder blades and the left side of the neck﻿4Review the captured data.﻿If your Flipper Zero doesn't detect the microchipThe microchip may be out of range. -> Try to move your Flipper Zero in the patterns shown above with smaller steps and hold the device at each stop a bit longer.The microchip might migrate from the original location. -> Try to cover a larger area with your Flipper Zero.Metal objects and electronic equipment may affect the detection of the microchip. -> Try to scan the animal away from the these objects.The animal might have a high-frequency RFID microchip. -> Try to scan itusing the NFC application.The animal might have an unsupported type of microchip. -> Contact your local veterinary clinic to scan the animal with their equipment.﻿Animal RFID microchip data structureAfter you capture the microchip data, Flipper Zero will display the information about the animal: microchip type, ID number, microchip data, and animal temperature (if the microchip can measure it).Data structure of an ISO-compliant FDX-B microchip﻿ISO-compliant animal microchips have 15-digit ID numbers.
